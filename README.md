Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. This version, built with Unity, extends the gameplay into three dimensions to provide even more challenging and exciting gameplay.
